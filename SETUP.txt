To set up the dev server of this web app is required pip package manager.

Python3 has to be installed on your local machine

in case pip is not installed in the terminal window type:

$ sudo apt update
>>
$ sudo apt-get install pip
>>
$ pip --version



after that Django has to be installed.

$ pip3 install django



after that cd in the Project directory and run the following command:

$ python3 manage.py runserver

you will receive an output that looks like this:

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
May 17, 2022 - 15:02:06
Django version 3.2.5, using settings 'Project.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

when you receive this output just type 127.0.0.1 in your browser search bar.

the website is now launched on your local machine's dev serer and ready to be tested.

Have fun :)
